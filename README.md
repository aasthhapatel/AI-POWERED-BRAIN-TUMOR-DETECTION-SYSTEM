# AI-POWERED-BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-SYSTEM

PROBLEM STATEMENT - Deep Learning–Based MRI Brain Tumor Classification | Flask Web App | Medical Imaging

📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Brain Tumor Detection System is a deep-learning–driven web application designed to analyze MRI brain scans and detect tumor presence with high accuracy.
The application uses a trained Keras model (model_new2.keras) served through a Flask backend, and provides a beautiful, responsive web interface for real-time MRI analysis.

This project demonstrates the integration of AI + Web Development + Medical Imaging in one complete system.
